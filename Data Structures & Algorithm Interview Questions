Data Structures & Algorithm Interview Questions

1. What is a data structure?
	- The way data is organized and manipulated.
2. Describe the 5 types of Data Structures?
	- Arrays -> A collection of values that are all the same data type
	- Lists -> A collection of related things linked to the previous and/or following data items.
	- Trees -> A data structure that organizes data in a hierarchical framework
	- Tables -> The data is saved in the form of rows and columns.
	- Records -> A collection of fields, each of which contains data from a single data type.
3. What is a linear data structure? Name a few examples.
	- A data structure who elements are arranged in a sequence or in a linear order?
	- Examples: Arrays, Linked List, Stacks, Queues, Strings
4. What are some applications of data structures?
	- Data management, operating systems, AI, compilers, database management, graphics, simulation
5. What is a multidimensional array?
	- An array of arrays
	- Examples: [['My', 'First', 'Array'],
				 ['My', 'Second', 'Array']]
6. What is a linked list data structure?
	- Sequence of data objects that are not stored in adjacent memory locations
	- Each element is a seperate object called a node.
	- Contain two fields: data field and a reference to the next node
	- Linked lists are a dynamic data structure where the nodes are not fixed and the list can grow or shrink
7. Are linked lists considered linear or non-linear data structures?
	- Both, it depends on the application
	- When used to access it is considered linear
	- When used for storage it is considered non-linear
8. What are the advantages of linked list over arrays?
	- It is a dynamic data structure - no need to define and intial size
	- Insertion and deletion
	- No wasted memory - the required memory will grow and shrink with demand
9. In which scenarios do we use linked list and when do we use an array?
	Linked List better:
	- When you don't know the upper limit of elements
	- When there will be a large number of inserts and deletions
	- When you want to insert into the middle of a data structure
	Array better:
	- When you know the upper limit of elements beforehand
	- Anytime memory is a concern and we want to limit the memory that a data structure uses
	- When you need to index or randomly access data
	- When you need speed to iterate through elements
10. What is a doubly linked list? Give some examples.
	- A linked list where the node points to both the previous and the next node
	- Browser cached that knows where you were before and after the previous page
	- Music playlist
11. How do you reference all of the elements in a one-dimensional array?
	- Through an indexed loop (for loop / while loop)
12. What are dynamic data structures? Name a few.
	- They have the ability to expand and contract based on the needs of the program / algorithm
	- Queues, Stacks, Dynamic Arrays, Linked Lists, Heap
13. What is an algorithm?
	- A step by step method of solving a problem or manipulating data
14. What is algorithm analysis?
	- Provides an estimate of the required resources to complete an algorithm
15. Why do we need to do an algorithm analysis?
	- We want algorithms to be as efficient as possible
	- So we can optimize algorithms based on time / space needs
16. What is a stack?
17. Where are stacks used?
18. What are the operations that can be performed on a stack?
19. What is a postfix expression? Give a few examples.
20. What is a queue data structure?
21. List some applications of a queue.
22. What is dequeue?
23. What operations can be performed on queues?
24. What is a heap?
25. What are the advantages of a heap over a stack?
26. What is the difference between a PUSH and a POP?
27. Which sorting algorithm is considered to be the fastest? Why?
28. What is merge sort? How does it work?
29. How does a selection sort work?
30. What is an asymptotic analysis of an algorithm?
31. What are asymptotic notations?
32. What are some examples of divide and conquer algorithms?
33. What is a graph data structure?
34. What are the applications of a graph data structure?
35. List the types of trees?
36. What are binary trees?
37. What are the differences between the B tree and the B+ tree?
38. What are the advantages of binary search over a linear search?
39. What is an AVL tree?
40. What is the difference between NULL and VOID?
41. Name the ways to determine whether a linked list is a loop.
42. List some applications of multilinked data structures.
43. Explain the jagged array.
44. Explain the max heap data structure.
45. How do you find the height of a node in a tree?


Dynamic Arrays?
Heap?
