Question:

Given an array of competitions and an array of results. Determine the winner of a tournament.


Steps to solving DS & Algo Problems:

Step 1: Verify the constraints
	- Can there be more than one winner?
		- There will be one winner
	- Can there be ties?
		- There will be no ties
	- Does ranking matter?
		- Doesn't matter, simply return the winner
	- What do the input looks like?
	- What do you want me to return?
		- Return a string that is the winners name
Step 2: Write out some test cases
	- competitions = [
    					["HTML", "C#"],
    					["C#", "Python"],
    					["Python", "HTML"]
  					]
  	- results = [0, 0, 1] -> "HTML", "C#", "HTML"
  	- return = "HTML"
Step 3: Figure out a solution without code
	- Loop through the length of competitions array
	- Evaluate the winner at each index of the competitions array
	- Keep track of all competitors scores
Step 4: Write out the solution in code
	â€¢ Is this code DRY?
Step 5: Double check for errors
Step 6: Test code with test cases
Step 7: Analyze space and time complexity
Step 8: Can we optimize the solution?
Step 9: Walk through code with test cases using optimized solution

// Time Complexity: O(n) -> Linear
// Space Complexity: O(n) -> Linear

// Time complexity => represents the numbers of times a statement is executed.
// Space complexity => the total amount of memory space used by a algorithm
